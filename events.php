  <h2>Alfresco at Bogle Vineyards &amp; Winery</h2>

  <p>Cup With Love is very grateful to <a href="http://www.boglewinery.com/">Bogle Vineyards &amp; Winery</a> for hosting us for a fundraiser on July 18, 2014. The entrance proceeds from their regular Friday Alfresco event will go to support Cup With Love and help us reach more people on their cancer journeys.</p>

  <p>Come join us for great wine, music by the <a href="http://www.meremortalsband.com/">Mere Mortals Band</a> with Kyle Rowland, and food by Chando's Tacos in the gorgeous setting of Bogle Winery!</p>
