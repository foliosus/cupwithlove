<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.mylifetime.com/" title="Lifetime home page">Lifetime</a>'s 15th annual National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and <a href="http://www.vespausa.com/" title="Vespa promotion page">Vespa USA</a>, we are thrilled to have been able offer a pink LX 50 Vespa scooter (one of a limited edition of 1000) to a lucky raffle winner.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that (cancer survivor) Stan Czarnecki of Ocala, Florida, is the winner of our LX 50 Pink Vespa contest. Stan’s ticket was chosen on November 1st, at our raffle drawing event at <a href="http://www.hotitalian.net" title="Raffle venue" rel="nofollow">Hot Italian Pizza and Panini Bar</a>, from more than 1,000 tickets sold to support the Cup With Love’s cup donation program.</p>

<h4>Congratulations, Stan!</h4>

<p>We also want to thank all of the people who entered the contest to support the Cup With Love Project. Our only regret is that there can only be one winner. We look forward to serving many more people impacted by cancer because of everyone's contributions.</p>
