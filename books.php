    <h4>About the authors</h4>

    <p><a href="http://www.rothtalent.com/speakers/slist/bodai" title="Visit the author's speaker page">Ernie Bodai</a>, M.D. was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1951. He and his family lived in a bomb shelter for nearly a year, before they managed to escape during the Hungarian Revolution in 1957. Following immigration to the United States, Dr. Bodai received his B.A and M.S. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles.  He received his M.D. degree from the University of California, Davis in 1977, where he currently serves as Clinical Professor of Surgery.  He has authored over 250 medical articles and has published 5 books, 4 of which focus on cancer. After treating thousands of patients with breast cancer he became frustrated at the pace of funding for research.  In a remarkable one-man lobbying effort he was able to convince Congress and the U.S. Postal Service to issue the Breast Cancer Research Stamp &mdash; the first ever stamp in U.S. history that sells at more than face value (45 cents) with the surplus amount donated directly to breast cancer research.  Over 800 million stamps have been sold raising over $60 million for crucial research.</p>

    <h4>About the author</h4>

    <p><a href="http://karensfaithandsurvivor77.shutterfly.com/" title="Visit the author's site">Karen Rice</a>'s bio, in her own words: &#8220;Born in Houston, Texas, I was the seventh child growing up in a very large family. Even with so many around, I always found a way to sneak a little time for myself in a hide-away space to dream. I grew up in the church, as my father was a Baptist minister. While in high school, my life was all planned out by becoming a model/actress, and I worked at it, while also working at other jobs to raise my child alone after a broken marriage. Later in life I had a head-on-collision with breast cancer and it changed my entire outlook on life. Through my tragedy and all that I've had to endure, it became an awakening for me, where I received all the strength and encouragement to write down my thoughts to share with others. My life was hit with cancer not one time, but twice now; but it won't stop me from striving to place positive outlooks for myself, as well as others, for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
